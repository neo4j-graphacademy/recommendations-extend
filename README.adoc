= Extended Recommendations Dataset

This is an extended version of the link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations[recommendations^] dataset.

The original recommendations dataset was extracted from the dump file into a series of CSV files.

Faker is used to generate additional data including:

* Additional `User` properties
* `Address` nodes and `LIVES_AT` relationships
* `Stream` nodes and `STARTED` and `STREAMED` relationships
* `PURCHASED` relationships between `User` and `Movie`
